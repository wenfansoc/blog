        <h3>2012-05-30 quotes from R. G. Collingwood: <em>An Autobiography</em>
</h3>

<ul>
<li>I know now that this is what always happens when I am in the early stages of work on a problem. Until the problem has gone a long way towards being solved, I do not know what it is; all I am conscious of is this vague perturbation of mind, this sense of being worried about I cannot say what. (p. 4)</li>
<li>… knowledge comes only by answering questions, and that these questions must be the right questions and asked in the right order. (p. 25)</li>
<li>I therefore taught my pupils, more by example than by precept, that they must never accept any criticism of anybody’s philosophy which they might hear or read without satisfying themselves by first0hand study that this was the philosophy he actually expounded; that they must always defer any criticism of their own until they were absolutely sure they understood the text they were criticizing; and that if the postponement was <em>sine die</em> it did not greatly matter. (p. 27)</li>
<li>A man whose mind is always being stirred up by philosophical teaching can hardly be expected to achieve the calm, the inner silence, which is one condition of philosophical thinking. (p. 28)</li>
<li>I begin by observing that you cannot find out what a man means by simply studying his spoken or written statements, even though he has spoken or written with perfect command of language and perfectly truthful intention. In order to find out his meaning you must also know what the questions was (a question in his own mind, and presumed by him to be in yours) to which the thing he has said or written was meant as an answer. (p. 31)</li>
<li>No two propositions, I saw, can contradict one another unless they are answers to the same questions. (p. 33)</li>
<li>In logic I am a revolutionary; and like other revolutionaries I can thank God for the reactionaries. They clarify the issue. (p. 52)</li>
<li>History did not mean knowing what events followed what. It meant getting inside other people’s heads, looking at their situation through their eyes, and thinking for yourself whether the way in which they tackled it was the right way. (p. 58)</li>
<li>The sameness is the sameness of an historical process, and the difference is the difference between one thing which in the course of that process has turned into something else, and the other thing into which it has turned. (p. 62)</li>
<li>If there were a permanent problem P, we could ask “what did Kant, or Leibniz, or Berkeley, think about P?” and if that question could be answered, we could then go on to ask “was Kant, or Leibniz, or Berkeley, right in what he thought about P?” But what is thought to be a permanent problem P is really a number of transitory problems p_1p_2p_3 … whose individual peculiarities are blurred by the historical myopia of the person who lumps them together under the one name P. It follows that we cannot fish the problem P out of the hyperuranian lucky-bag, hold it up, and say “what did So-and-so think about this?” We have to begin, as poor devils of historians begin, from the other end. We have to study documents and interpret them. We have to say “here is a passage of Leibniz; what is it about? What is the problem with which it deals?” Perhaps we label that problem p_14. Then comes the question “Does Leibniz here deal with p_14 rightly or wrongly?” (p. 69)</li>
<li>Never think you understand any statement made by a philosopher until you have decided, with the utmost possible accuracy, what the question is to which he means it for an answer. (p. 74)</li>
<li>In this sense, knowledge advances by proceeding not “from the known to the unknown”, but from the “unknown” to the “known”. Obscure subjects, by forcing us to think harder and more systematically, sharpen our wits and thus enable us to dispel the fog of prejudice and superstition in which our minds are often wrapped when we think about what is familiar to use. (p. 86)</li>
<li>History is concerned not with “events” but with “processes”; that “processes” are things which do not begin and end but turn into one another; and that if a process P_1 turns into a process P_2, there is no dividing line at which P_1 stops and P_2 begins; P_1 never stops, it goes on in the changed form P_2, and P_2 never begins, it has previously been going on in the earlier form P_1. There are in history no beginnings and no endings. (p. 97 – p. 98)</li>
<li>I have been preaching to my archaeological friends the duty of never digging either a five-thousand-pound site or a five-shilling trench without being certain that you can satisfy an inquirer who asks you “what are you doing this piece of work for?” … A second principle was that, since history proper is the history of thought, there are no mere “events” in history: what is miscalled an “event” is really an action, and expresses some thought (intention, purpose) of its agent; the historian’s business is therefore to identify this thought … A third principle was that no historical problem should be studied without studying what I called its second-order history; that is, the history of historical thought about it. (p. 126 – p. 132)</li>
<li>If you want to know why a certain kind of thing happened in a certain kind of case, you must begin by asking, “What did you expect?” You must consider what the normal development is in cases of that kind. Only then, if the thing that happened in this case was exceptional, should you try to explain it by appeal to exceptional conditions. (p. 140)</li>

<p>这篇的内容来自andrew gelman，原文在<a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2009/07/advice_on_writi/">这里</a>。</p>

<p>他提出的一个最主要的方法是用下面的几步来重新搭建文章，注意前提是你已经完成了研究，只剩下将结果表述出来的问题：</p>

<p>第一，先写结论。发现了什么，有什么建议。在进行这个过程的同时你也可以开始考虑开头的引言该怎么写，尤其关注你需要在引言中给出多少的背景介绍（从而读者能了解你的结论）。</p>

<p>第二，写论证部分，也就是你有什么经验材料支持你的结论。</p>

<p>第三，用的方法和数据。</p>

<p>第四，文献回顾和引言部分。</p>

<p>第五，结果和结论部分，以及有没有另外的解释同样成立。哪里可能会出错、局限、对以后的研究有什么指导意义。</p>

<p>第六，摘要。他的建议是可以从头五个自然段每段摘取第一句话，组成摘要，然后在此基础上修改。</p>

<p>第七，让一个朋友花15分钟来看这篇文章，看其能否抓住这篇文章想要传达的讯息。</p>

<p>他还提了两个基本原则：</p>

<ul>
<li>有些文字，如果你不指望读者会读，就不要写</li>
<li>表和图中的每一个数字都要有意义，不要加冗余信息</li>
</ul><p>如下是几条更为具体的建议。</p>

<ul>
<li>去掉如下的词：of course, note that, interestingly, very, nice, we can see that, it is important to note that</li>
<li>要给文章编页码</li>
<li>除非是文章的核心，否则尽量不要用首字母缩写</li>
<li>结论不能太短</li>
</ul><p>以下来自其他相关的文章：</p>

<ul>
<li>一定要在引言写文章的贡献</li>
<li>first idea/intuition, then details</li>
<li>start early, very early</li>
</ul><hr><h3>2012-05-23 我的博士论文</h3>

<p>打算明年毕业，希望今年能将博士论文初稿写出来。题目现在都没仔细想过，给研院交proposal的时候直接就写了个_China's Cultural Revolution, Education Attainment, Send-Down Experience, and Long-term Health_。导师给我改了下，_Cost of Coming of Age in China's Cultural Revolution? Education Attainment, Send-Down Experience, and Long-term Health_。果然改后感觉就好很多，当然标题这东西谁也说不准，最后估计又是旁的了。</p>

<p>从标题就可以看出，落点是在文革那一代人的健康。我刚开始写研究计划的时候，打算同时做period effect和cohort effect，答辩的时候大家都觉得内容太多了，可以删掉些，我想了想，发现自己其实最感兴趣的还是那一代人，而不是当时发生了什么，最重要的，我没有好的数据来回答cohort effect，所以最终决定抽掉时期效应，仅仅研究代际效应。</p>

<p>文革可以被看作为一个自然实验（natural experiment），我在这个问题上纠缠了很久，以后继续写文章谈。问题主要在于到底treatment是什么，是哪一个层次上的分析，外生是相对于谁的外生？还好我的博士委员会在这个问题上帮了我很多。</p>

<p>初步打算分为三个部分：</p>

<ul>
<li>文革对健康的影响。这是最为简单的一个问题，文革的外生性让我可以在比较合理的假设下解答这个问题，就像做实验，我甚至都不需要控制太多的变量和做很多justification。</li>
<li>下面两个问题探讨的是机制，文革究竟是如何对健康产生影响的。这两个问题我觉得会比较难回答，主要因为它们牵涉到怎么做机制研究，这个问题又够写几篇的了，不过主要的问题倒是几句话可以讲清楚的。比如说a影响b从而影响c，很难知道如果没有a的情况下b会怎样影响c，因为不像a，中间因素b并不是外生的。

<ul>
<li>文革对健康的影响在多大程度上是由教育的中断造成的。</li>
<li>文革对健康的影响在多大程度上是由下放经历造成的。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>因为文革冲击的主要是受教育程度高的人，所以第三个问题考虑的是以上两个问题的答案会不会随个人的阶级出身不同而异。特别的，和惯常情况相反，是不是在中国会出现受教育程度越高受到的健康冲击越大这种情况。</li>
</ul><hr><h3>2012-05-22 Hello World!</h3>
